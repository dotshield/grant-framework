## Project Overview
### Overview

- **Name:** .Shield Wallet (Browser Extension)
- **Brief Description:** EOS EVM wallet with user-friendly interface that allows seamless interaction with the EOS EVM blockchain, enabling users to manage tokens and assets on the EOS EVM network. The wallet will provide secure access to tokens and digital assets on the EOS EVM network.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** The project extends the capabilities of the EOS EVM blockchain by providing a dedicated wallet application for easy token management and transaction execution.
- **Reason for Interest:** We are interested in creating this project to bridge the gap between users and the EOS EVM ecosystem, making it easier for them to manage their assets and participate in the EOS EVM network.

### Project Details

- **Seamless connection to EOS EVM:** Users can connect their wallets to the EOS EVM blockchain using Web3.js for interaction with smart contracts and transactions.
- **Tokens Management:** Users can view and manage their EOS EVM tokens through an intuitive UI.
- **Secure Transactions:** The wallet will provide a user-friendly interface for creating and signing transactions securely.
- **Transaction History:** Users can track and review their transaction history within the wallet.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Users can create encrypted backups of their private keys and implement a secure account recovery process.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? A: The project fills the need for a dedicated wallet solution for EOS EVM users, providing an easy way to manage tokens and interact with the EOS EVM
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? A: The target audience includes EVM blockchain users, developers building on EOS EVM, and individuals seeking a convenient way to manage their assets on the EOS EVM network.
- What need(s) does your project meet? A: The wallet meets the need for a secure, user-friendly tool for managing EOS EVM assets and participating in the ecosystem.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem? A: There are other wallet projects in the EOS Network, but this project differentiates itself by specifically targeting the EOS EVM network, providing a seamless experience for its users.

### Team Experience

I have developed software development skills and abilities that have allowed me to contribute to and create an open source project called genki, I have several years of experience in the blockchain area, including contributions to blockchain projects. I have previously launched a media portal on EOS and applied for a Pomelo grant for that project.

## Development Status
I have conducted preliminary research and analysis of the EOS EVM network, identified key technical requirements, and initiated discussions with potential users to gather feedback. We have not yet started the actual coding.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

### Milestone Summary
